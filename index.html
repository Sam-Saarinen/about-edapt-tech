          <p>Edapt Technologies created and deployed <a href="https://finlitri.org">FinLitRI.org</a>, an adaptive assessment platform that measures proficiency in financial literacy relative to <a href="https://www.councilforeconed.org/national-standards-for-personal-financial-education/">Rhode-Island adopted standards</a>. The platform is officially recommended by the Rhode Island Department of Education for proficiency assessment in their <a href="https://www.ride.ri.gov/Portals/0/Uploads/Documents/Financial%20Literacy/RIDE%20Financial%20Literacy%20Implementation%20Guide%20-%20Proficiency_033122.pdf?ver=2022-03-31-115331-520">Financial Literacy Proficiency Implementation Guide</a>, and is now being used by schools in Rhode Island and by several non-profits with national reach.</p>
          <p>Our company was ideally suited to respond to the need for this assessment due to our ability to rapidly generate and validate efficient adaptive assessments for new content. The <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText19/SenateText19/S0112A.pdf">legislation</a> requiring financial literacy education and proficiency assessment in the state was signed into law in <a href="https://www.ride.ri.gov/InstructionAssessment/FinancialLiteracy.aspx">June 2021</a>, and requires schools to begin offering financial literacy education during the 2022-2023 school year. The official standards were only adopted in December 2021, leaving only a short window of time for an assessment solution to be created that could be used to evaluate educational offerings the following academic year. Edapt Technologies leveraged our quizi.us platform to create <a href="https://finlitri.org">FinLitRI.org</a>, an adaptive assessment platform with statistically-validated and standards-aligned assessment items. By leveraging our continual validation and item-sourcing technologies, we were able to fill a critical gap in the research and infrastructure for financial literacy education. For this work, our company was recognized by the State Treasurer, the Chartered Financial Analyst Society Providence (CFA Society Providence), Financial Planners Association Rhode Island (FPA-RI), and the Rhode Island Department of Education.</p>
          <p><a href="https://finlitri.org">FinLitRI.org</a> is now being deployed in classrooms and by several nonprofits with national reach in order to collect data that can help increase educational efficacy over the coming year.</p>
