About

Who are we?
Edapt Technologies is a company founded in 2019 by (S)am. Based on years of AI, education, and product design research, we are now releasing services to manage and optimize human learning.

What are our values?
Edapt Technologies is committed to providing quality education worldwide. Our desire is to produce scalable educational interventions of proven pedagogical efficacy with equitable access to all students. For this reason, we invest heavily in research and we provide our solutions for free to students.


How do we make money?
Edapt Technologies offers management and analytics APIs for each of its services. For a small subscription fee per managed student, educational institutions and EdTech companies are able to track the progress of students who have opted in, assign content to them, and integrate our services with their larger platform and vision. We also maintain Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplaces for the sale of specialized content related to some of our services.

Memory

Remember forever, for 5 minutes a day. That’s the promise of the new study aid Edapt Technologies is releasing this Summer. With this app, you’ll be able to choose what to remember. Whether it’s vocabulary, definitions, processes, lines, speeches, faces, or shortcuts, this app has got your back. Check out some of the technologies this app is built on:

Spaced Repetition
As memories become stronger, they last longer. By reviewing at just the right times, you can space out your review in increasing intervals. Remember anything forever with minimal effort by allowing this app to schedule when you review.

Machine Learning
Predicting the future is hard, and not everybody is the same. That’s why we use advanced statistical methods to figure out how long each of your memories will last. Combine that with our research into rehearsal scheduling, and you’ve got an app that adapts to your learning speed and knowledge.

Gamification
No one wants something they do every day to be boring! That’s why we give you a direct incentive to practice. The more things you remember in 5 minutes, the more new facts you’re able to add to the app for the next day. But use those points fast! They expire in 36 hours.
